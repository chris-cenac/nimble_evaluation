# üè• Patient Records Management System ‚Äì Nimble Evaluation Submission

## üìÑ Overview

This repository contains a two-part evaluation project for the **Software Engineer I** role at **Nimble**. The solution fulfills the technical requirements outlined in the [Software Engineer I Evaluation Assignment](./Software%20Engineer%20I%20Evaluation%20Assignment.pdf).

The application is a **Patient Recording System** designed to manage and store essential patient details, including:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Date of Birth
- Gender
- Blood Type
- Allergies
- Medical History

---

## üß† Project Structure

This is a **monorepo** structured into two main folders:
```

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend # AdonisJS REST API
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend # React + Vite PWA

````

---

## üöß Known Limitations

Due to financial and technical challenges, the backend was not fully deployed to a cloud-based hosting platform. However:

- The **database** is hosted on **Google Cloud SQL**, satisfying the non-local storage requirement.
- All environment variables needed to connect to the cloud-hosted database will be **provided via email**. You will not need to create your own cloud database instance.

---

## üîô Backend (AdonisJS)

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- **Node.js v20.4+ (LTS)**
- **AdonisJS CLI**
  ```bash
  npm i -g @adonisjs/cli
````

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

```bash
cd backend
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Copy the `.env` file:**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The required `.env` file with Google Cloud SQL credentials will be sent via email.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. **Run database migrations:**

```bash
node ace migration:run
```

5. **Seed the database with sample patient data:**

```bash
node ace db:seed
```

6. **Start the development server:**

```bash
node ace serve --watch
```

- API base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api`

---

## üîê Authentication

The backend uses **JWT-based authentication**. You must register and login to access protected endpoints.

Use the returned access token in the `Authorization` header for secured routes:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

---

## üì¨ API Overview

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                 |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| GET    | /api/patients      | Fetch all patient records   |
| GET    | /api/patients/\:id | Get a single patient record |
| POST   | /api/patients      | Create a new patient        |
| PUT    | /api/patients/\:id | Update patient details      |
| DELETE | /api/patients/\:id | Delete a patient            |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (React + Vite)

The frontend is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** built with **React** and **Vite**. It can be installed directly from the browser onto:

- **Android**
- **iOS**
- **Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)**

### üß∞ Technologies Used

- **React (w/ Context API)** for component-level and global state management.
- **React Query** for efficient server state management and live data updates.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive UI.
- **PWA Support** for installability and offline caching.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend URL: `http://localhost:5173`

> The app will automatically connect to the backend running on `http://localhost:8080/api`.

## üß© Potential Enhancements

Future improvements that can enhance functionality and scalability include:

- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** ‚Äì Limit or grant access based on user roles (e.g. admin, doctor, nurse).
- **Appointment Scheduling System** ‚Äì Link patients with specific appointment dates and providers.
- **Search & Filter** ‚Äì Find patients by age, blood type, medical conditions, etc.
- **Export/Print Support** ‚Äì Generate patient reports in PDF or CSV formats.
- **Audit Logging** ‚Äì Track all record updates and accesses for accountability.
- **Notifications** ‚Äì Alerts for allergies, medication interactions, or upcoming appointments.
- **Cloud Deployment** ‚Äì Full backend deployment on AWS/GCP/Fly.io (planned for future phase).
